# Test drive Typescript with a basic calendar UI

Create a first react app with typescript and a responsive minimalist calendar UI to strengthen my understanding of Typescript and create interfaces with monthdays, dates, and weekdays as custom types.

No calendar libraries are to be used. Start out by following a basic typescript tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKhBqbuzDMI

Pratice using Material UI icons as needed.
